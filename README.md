Proposal
------
We *propose* to build a Datbase Migration tool to remediate some of the hassles of migrating.  The application will allow a user to import data from one or more  database tables, which it will store in temporary table.  The user can then import or create  a target database that will be displayed along side source tables, and allow user to execute 1 or more scripting commands to alter the data prior to inserting it into the target database, preview and commit a final table.



------
We are planning to build the page(s) with React as our new technology.
Use Passport for authentication.
Use Node and Express for the Server and Routing
Sequilize for all database commands.
Heroku Deployment, with JawsDB
------
Stretch ideas:


+Incorporate Charts
+Electron to make a desktop app
